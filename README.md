	Santoro, A., Raposo, D., Barrett, D. G., Malinowski, M., Pascanu, R., Battaglia, P., & Lillicrap, T. (2017). A simple neural network module for relational reasoning. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 4967-4976).

For evaluation purposes we use an existing version of the Sort-Of-CLEVR dataset, available through kaggle. This dataset contains of 10000 images with questions encoded in vectors.
